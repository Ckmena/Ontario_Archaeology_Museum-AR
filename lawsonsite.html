            <h3>The Lawson Site</h3>
            <p>
                Longhouses were built with a frame of saplings supported by large posts in the house interior, typical
                longhouses were covered with sheets of bark such as elm bark and birch. Openings at either end were used
                as doors, while openings in the roof acted like chimneys, letting the smoke from the fires out.
                Fireplaces or hearths were spaced down the length of a central corridor in the house (an average of 1-6
                fires), and were flanked with two platforms: the lower for sleeping, and the upper for food and storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The historic record shows that each hearth was shared by two families; one family lived on either side
                of the longhouse. On average, families had six to eight members. A medium sized longhouse like the one
                reconstructed at the Lawson site, would have been occupied by 38-40 people, all related through the
                female line. When a couple got married, the husband would move into his wifeâ€™s family longhouse.
